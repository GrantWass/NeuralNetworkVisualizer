Interpretation: The network learns to recognize **handwritten digits** by adjusting weights to reduce **classification errors**.`;

3. [**Backward Propagation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation): The error is **back-propagated** to update weights.

How to Interpret Results:  
- A **lower loss** means better performance.  
- In **classification tasks**, the class with the highest probability is the prediction.  
- In **regression tasks**, the output value should approach **real-world targets**.`;

Each layer has **neurons** that process information before passing it to the next layer.

Hidden layers act as **feature detectors**:  
- **Early layers** capture simple patterns

Too many layers can lead to **overfitting** (memorizing data).  
Regularization techniques like **dropout** and **batch normalization** help mitigate this.`;
